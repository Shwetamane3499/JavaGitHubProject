
Methods in Java

1.Built in methods-->println(), nextInt(),Math.sqrt(),length(),Array.sort()
2.User defined methods---a)instance method  b)static methods


1.Built in methods/predefined methods:

println();
System.exit();
nextInt();
length();


2.Userdefined methods:
Methods written by user are called userdefined methods

a)Instance methods:
These methods act upon the instance variable.To call the instance method,
object is needed.These methods also have the access to static variables.

syntax :  public int sum(int a,int b)

public: access modifiers
int: return type
sum: name of method
(int a,int b):  parameters

-Method names always start with small letters, if want to add more than words write in camelcase
Ex..
sumOfNum();
sum();
findEvenOdd();

-instance methods are called using object name
obj.methodName();

Ex. class Student
     {
	   int rollnum;
                  String name;
                  
	   public void printStudent()
                       {
		   Sysout(rollnum);
                                Sysout(name);	
                       }
               public static void main(String args[ ])
	  {
	      Student s1=new Student();
                     s1.printStudent();

	}
    }

Ex:1.Ex:Create Student class and  write initStudent() and printStudent() and create two object and invoke methods

b) Static method:
* A static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.
* A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance(object) of a class.
* A static method can access static data members only and can change the value of it.
* A instance method can have access to static variable but static method can'nt.
*we use class name to access static data members(static variables,static method)
*Static method is used to perform some operation on static data(variables)/utility methods.
*static variables allocates memory only once when class is loaded in memory
*static data members allocates space in class/static/method area.
*static data members(static variables,static methods )are shared by all objects of class where 
static data members are defined

*Advantages of static variables
--static variables are memory efficient(saves memory),it allocates space for common properties
 only once in method/static area.

*Application:
--flight ticket counter,total num of seats in flight are static, user will see only updated available seats
-use of static count variable to count num of emplyees in company

Demo Create class Employee with static variable companyName , eid,ename,sal and 
write static  method setCompanyNm()

LAB 2:
1.Using scanner class accept string from user like "sun","Mon","Tue"  and print appropriate day for accepted string like 
for "Sun"  print msg "Its sunday" like wise.
2.Create Mydate class with dd,mm,yy instance variable and initMydate() and printMydate() instance method 
create two object and call methods
3.Ex.Create class Employee with initEmp() and displayEmp() methods create two objects and invoke all methods.
4.Create class Student with name,rollnum,marks and initStudent and printStudent methods and static variable 
college name and static method setCollegeName.Create two objects and invoke all methods.
